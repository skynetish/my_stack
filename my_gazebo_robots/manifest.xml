  <description brief="Launch files for creating simulated robots in gazebo." >

    This package is a collection of launch files used to create various robots
    in gazebo.  The idea is that launching these files should be equivalent to
    powering on the created robots.  Drivers for controllers and sensors may be
    included in robot descriptions as gazebo plugins, or they may need to be
    run separately.
