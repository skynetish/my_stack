  <description brief="A collection of robot descriptions." >

    This package is a collection of robot descriptions.  Most robots have
    descriptions in their own robot-specific packages, but these descriptions
    are often written in inconsistent or even incorrect ways, using differing
    naming conventions and improper namespace handling.  In particular, many
    robot descriptions do not properly allow all topics to be pushed into a
    particular namespace, which causes problems for multi-robot setups.  This
    package tries to clean up these robot descriptions and present them in a
    consistent manner, while also providing a place to store customised robot
    descriptions.

    The robot descriptions are stored in *.urdf.xacro format, and they should
    be edited directly.  The xacro package is used to load the descriptions
    into the parameter server.

    It is suggested that robot descriptions use the following file structure:

      urdf/
        common.xacro          - common xacro definitions
        (part).urdf[.xacro]   - definition of robot part (element has no name)

      robots/
        (robot).urdf[.xacro]  - definition of robot (robot element has name)

    By convention, each robot should subscribe to the following topics:

      geometry_msgs/Twist   cmd_vel             Desired velocity
      (...add entries for other controllers)

    By convention each robot may publish the following topics:

      nav_msgs/Odometry     pose_ground_truth   Ground truth pose
      nav_msgs/Odometry     odom                Odometric updates
      nav_msgs/Odometry     imu                 Inertial updates
      (...add entries for other sensors)
